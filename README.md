## Introduction

The Driver Assist Automatic Pneumatic Braking System is designed to enhance vehicle safety by providing automatic braking assistance during emergency situations. The system utilizes wheel speed and mathematical calculations to determine the vehicle speed and stopping distance.

This repository provides the Arduino code and circuit diagram necessary to implement the system. Additionally, it includes a detailed explanation of the mathematical theory used to calculate the vehicle speed and stopping distance.

## Mathematical Theory

The system relies on the following mathematical equations:

1. **Vehicle Speed Calculation:**

   Speed of the car in km/h = (wheel circumference × RPM of wheel × 60) / 1000

   This equation calculates the vehicle speed based on the wheel circumference and the RPM of the wheel.

2. **Stopping Distance Calculation:**

   s = (0.278 × t × v) + (v² / (254 × (f + G)))

   - s: Stopping distance in meters.
   - t: Perception-reaction time in seconds.
   - v: Speed of the car in km/h.
   - G: Grade (slope) of the road, expressed as a decimal. Positive for an uphill grade and negative for a downhill road.
   - f: Coefficient of friction between the tires and the road.

   This equation estimates the stopping distance by considering the perception-reaction time, vehicle speed, road grade, and coefficient of friction.

   The formulas mentioned above are derived from the book "A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets" and provide a theoretical foundation for the braking system.

## Installation

To set up the Driver Assist Automatic Pneumatic Braking System, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Upload the provided Arduino code to your Arduino board.
3. Connect the necessary hardware components as per the provided circuit diagram.
4. Ensure all connections are secure.
5. Power on the system and verify that it is functioning correctly.

## Usage

Once the system is installed and operational, it will continuously monitor the wheel speed and calculate the vehicle speed using the provided mathematical equation. It will also estimate the stopping distance based on the speed, road grade, and coefficient of friction.

To use the system:

1. Ensure the hardware components are properly connected and powered.
2. Start the vehicle.
3. The system will automatically calculate and display the vehicle speed and stopping distance.
4. In the event of an emergency situation, the pneumatic braking system will engage to assist the driver in reducing the stopping distance.

Note: The system assumes a perception-reaction time, road grade, and coefficient of friction. These parameters can be adjusted within the code to suit specific requirements.
